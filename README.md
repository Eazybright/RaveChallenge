# RaveChallenge
FlutterWave Challenge, building a product that uses rave API
I decide to build a product called ```SPAVE```, which is derived from two english words Spending and saving.
This product manages a user's spending and savings in a way by which you can save towards a goal as well as spend some amounts on regular intervals.

# App Features
First thing you do once you enter the app, Login or signup...
The app has the following features
1. Add Spendings 
2. Add Savings
3. Add card
4. Transaction History
5. Add Details


# Add Spendings
This is the part of the app where you add an expense for your spendings
This feature is important if you imagine a user interested in sending a particular amout to its destination at regular intervals (E.g paying child's pocket moeny or petty work's renumeration)
Note the Following parameters when adding spendings
1. Amount - Amount to spend per regular interval
2. Interval - Interval at which you want to send the payment, e.g monthly, quaterly
3. Info - The description of your spending
4. Account Number - The destination account number
5. Bank - Destination Bank


# Add Savings
This is the part of the app where you add your regular savings
This feature is important if you imagine a user who is quite the carefree spender and wants to achive some savings goals, 
the amount would be saved on your account till its complete. Then user can withdrawl to bank account

Note the Following parameters when adding spendings
1. Amount - Amount to save per regular interval
2. Interval - Interval at which you want to save the payment, e.g monthly, quaterly

# Add Card and Details 
This is the page where user completes their registration i.e provide bank details , phone number and other virtual details
When adding card, user is first charged a sum of #50 only so as to initiate a transaction to enable me save their card token for future charging.

#  Transaction History
Users' transaction history is saved in database for each transaction user performs for future references
